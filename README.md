# Monte-Carlo-Integration-Project

## Project Description

### What is it?
The **Monte Carlo Integration Visualization** is a project designed to display how the Monte Carlo integration method works, and understand how well the Monte Carlo integration method works in comparison to the the Riemann Sum method for a large number of points.

### How do you run it?
To run the **Monte Carlo Integration Visualization**, you must first enter every parameter into the TextField boxes. For example, the min and max bounds of Integration should be entered into their respective TextFields to to be interpreted into the program. When every field has been filled out with values that make sense for the program to interpret (e.g. an Expression in the "Equation" TextField), the program will automatically render and display the graphics depending on which integration method is selected, and compute the Net Area using said method.
